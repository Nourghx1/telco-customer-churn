# Telco Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project analyzes customer churn for a telecommunications company using Python.  
The goal is to understand the factors that influence churn and to build a predictive model that identifies customers who are likely to leave.

## Objectives
- Explore customer demographics, services, and account information
- Identify key factors associated with customer churn
- Perform statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
- Build a machine learning model to predict churn

## Dataset
The project uses the **Telco Customer Churn** dataset, which includes:
- **7,043 customers**
- **~50 features**, including:
  - Demographics (gender, age)
  - Services (internet type, contract type, payment method)
  - Account information (monthly charges, tenure)
  - Churn indicators and derived metrics (churn label, churn score, CLTV)

## Methodology
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to visualize churn patterns
- **Correlation analysis** between numerical features and churn
- **Hypothesis testing** to examine the relationship between churn and monthly charges
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifier for churn prediction

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Files
- `Customer Churn Prediction.ipynb` – Data analysis, visualizations, and KNN model
- `telco.csv` – Dataset used for the analysis
- `README.md` – Project documentation

## Notes
This project is intended for learning and portfolio purposes and demonstrates a complete data analysis and machine learning workflow.
